# The RAW measure in Kylin

@(2016-05-29 Xiaoyu Wang)

##Introduction
>`RAW` measure function is use to query the detail data on the measure column in Kylin.

Example data:

| DT         | SITE\_ID | SELLER\_ID | ITEM\_COUNT |
| :--------- | :------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| 2016-05-01 | 0        | SELLER-001 | 100         |
| 2016-05-01 | 0        | SELLER-002 | 200         |
| 2016-05-02 | 1        | SELLER-003 | 300         |
| 2016-05-02 | 1        | SELLER-004 | 400         |
| 2016-05-03 | 2        | SELLER-005 | 500         |

We design the cube desc is the `DT,SITE_ID` columns as dimensions, and `SUM(ITEM_COUNT)` as measure. So, the base cuboid data will like this:

| Rowkey of base cuboid | SUM(ITEM\_COUNT) |
| :-------------------- | :--------------- |
| 2016-05-01_0          | 300              |
| 2016-05-02_1          | 700              |
| 2016-05-03_2          | 500              |

For the first row in the base cuboid data, Kylin can extract the dimension column values `2016-05-01,0` from the HBase Rowkey, and in the measure cell will store the measure function's aggregated results `300`, we can't get the raw value `100` and `200` which before the aggregation on the `ITEM_COUNT` column.

The RAW function is use to make the SQL:
```
SELECT DT,SITE_ID,ITEM_COUNT FROM FACT_TABLE
```
to return the correct result:

| DT         | SITE\_ID | ITEM\_COUNT |
| :--------- | :------- | :---------- |
| 2016-05-01 | 0        | 100         |
| 2016-05-01 | 0        | 200         |
| 2016-05-02 | 1        | 300         |
| 2016-05-02 | 1        | 400         |
| 2016-05-03 | 2        | 500         |


##How to use
- Choose the Kylin version 1.5.1+.
- Like the above case, we can make the `DT,SITE_ID` as dimensions, and `RAW(ITEM_COUNT)`as measure.
- After the cube build, you can use the SQL to query the raw data:
```
SELECT DT,SITE_ID,ITEM_COUNT FROM FACT_TABLE WHERE SITE_ID = 0
```

##Optimize
The column which define `RAW` measure will be encoded with dictionary by default. So, you must know you data's cardinality and distribution characteristics.
- As far as possible to define the value uniform distribution column to dimensions, this will make the measure cell value size more uniform and avoid data skew.
- If choose the ultra high cardinality column to define `RAW` measure, you can try the following to avoid the dictionary build error:
  1. Cut a big segment into several segments, if you were trying to build a large data set at once;
  2. Set `kylin.dictionary.max.cardinality` in conf/kylin.properties to a bigger value (default is 5000000).


##To be improved
- Now, the maximum storage 1M values of `RAW` measure in one cuboid. If exceed 1M values, it will throw `BufferOverflowException` in the cube build. This will be optimized in the later release.
- Only dimension column can use in `WHERE` condition, `RAW` measure column is not support.


##Implement
- Custom one aggregation function `RAW` implement, the function's return type depends on the column type.
- Make the `RAW` aggregation function to save the column raw data in the base cuboid data.
- The HBase value cell will store the dictionary id of the raw data to save space.
- The SQL which contains the `RAW` measure column will be routed to the base cuboid query.
- Extract the raw data from base cuboid data with dimension values to assemble into a complete row when query.
